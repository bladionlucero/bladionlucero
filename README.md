## Meet Brittany Ladion-Lucero (or Britt for short) ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a digital product (UX/UI) designer and full-stack software engineer. Soâ€¦I guess you can call me a ~~ux engineer~~ ~~design technologist~~ person living their life at the intersection of design and code. Whew, that's...a lot.

Anyway! You can also visit [my website](https://www.brittanydoes.design/) to learn a little bit more about me and the work I've done.
